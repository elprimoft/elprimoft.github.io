## Overview

WhiteBoxAesCrack allows users to inject faults by specifying the address of the T-box or Tyibox in the white-box AES implementation. This tool is essential for researchers and developers working on cryptographic security and fault tolerance.

## Features

- **Fault Injection**: Specify addresses to inject faults into the T-box or Tyibox.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate and use.
- **Robust Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples.
- **Open Source**: Contribute and improve the tool with the community.

## Installation

To get started with WhiteBoxAesCrack, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elprimoft/WhiteBoxAesCrack.git
   cd WhiteBoxAesCrack
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can typically do this with:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Download the Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/elprimoft/WhiteBoxAesCrack/releases) to download the latest version. Make sure to execute the downloaded file.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using WhiteBoxAesCrack. Here‚Äôs a basic example of how to use the tool:

1. **Launch the Tool**:
   ```bash
   ./WhiteBoxAesCrack
   ```

2. **Input the Address**:
   When prompted, input the address of the T-box or Tyibox where you want to inject faults.

3. **Run the Process**:
   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the fault injection process.

## Fault Injection

Fault injection is a technique used to test the resilience of cryptographic algorithms. In WhiteBoxAesCrack, you can specify the exact address of the T-box or Tyibox to see how the system reacts to faults. This can help identify vulnerabilities in your implementation.

### How It Works

1. **Address Specification**: You provide the address where you want to inject a fault.
2. **Execution**: The tool modifies the behavior of the AES algorithm at the specified address.
3. **Result Analysis**: Analyze the output to see how the fault affected the encryption process.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use WhiteBoxAesCrack effectively:

### Example 1: Basic Fault Injection

```bash
./WhiteBoxAesCrack --address 0x123456
```

This command injects a fault at the specified address.

### Example 2: Advanced Options

```bash
./WhiteBoxAesCrack --address 0x123456 --mode advanced
```

This command runs the tool in advanced mode, allowing for more complex fault injection scenarios.
